This repository contains a docker project that builds a PHP API server with little help from libraries.

The aim of this project was to practice and gain understanding of the underlying principles of API servers since
creating one within the Laravel framework left me wanting answers.

To use:

From the same directory as this file run,

    cp .env.example .env
    docker-compose up -d

    docker exec -it app /bin/bash
    composer install

DB Creation

    docker exec db mysql -u root -p
    CREATE DATABASE api_db;

Authorization

    docker exec -it app /bin/bash
    cd public
    php client.php

Migration and Seeding

    docker exec -it app /bin/bash

    php migrate.php
    php seed.php

    OR, individually:

    php Migrations/UserTableMigration.php
    php Migrations/ProductTableMigration.php

    php Seeders/UsersTableSeeder.php
    php Seeders/ProductsTableSeeder.php

To test I run, or use Postman

    curl -X GET localhost:8080/api/users -H "Authorization: Bearer _TOKEN_"

ROUTES:
    URL/api/users {GET}
    URL/api/users/id {GET,DELETE}
    URL/api/products {GET}
    URL/api/products/id {GET,DELETE}
