This repository contains a docker project that builds a PHP API server with little help from libraries.

The aim of this project was to practice and gain understanding of the underlying principles of API servers since
creating one within the Laravel framework left me wanting answers.

To use:

From the same directory as this file run,

    cp .env.example .env
    docker-compose up -d

    docker exec -it app /bin/bash
    composer install

DB Creation
    docker exec db mysql -u root -p
    root

    CREATE DATABASE api_db;

Migration and Seeding

    docker exec -it app /bin/bash

    cd /Migrations
    php UserTableMigration.php
    php ProductTableMigration.php

    cd ../Seeders
    php UsersTableSeeder.php
    php ProductsTableSeeder.php

Use any API method you like, to test I run

    curl -X GET localhost:8080/api/users -H "Authorization: Bearer _TOKEN_"

ROUTES:
    URL/api/users
    URL/api/users/id
    URL/api/products
    URL/api/products/id
